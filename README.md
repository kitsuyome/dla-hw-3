# Text-to-Speech

## Objective

In this project explored the task of speech synthesis by implementing the FastSpeech2 model. The model was developed based on the paper ["FastSpeech 2: Fast and High-Quality End-to-End Text to Speech"](http://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset). For training the model, the [LJSpeech dataset](http://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset) was used.

An attempt was made to reproduce the results of the research and achieve high-quality synthesized speech, which was quite successful. Experiments were also conducted in speech synthesis with different pitches, speeds, and energies. The test audios are included in the Wandb report.
